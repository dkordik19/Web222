            <h3>Sorry, had no time to come up with the text, so Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              When we talking about responsive design, we are talking about a wide range of modern
              devices that have screens and access to the internet, because Responsive Design is
              what good developers should do to satisfy all those screens. I mean, nowadays, if you
              need to create a good web page you must be sure that this page looks great on all
              devices. There is no need for the user to see all the elements of a web page. The area
              that visible for a user called a "viewport". Including a “meta viewport” element to
              the web page helps the browser to show the content of a web page according to the
              device requesting the page. This technic is very handy and helps developers while
              working on responsive design.

            <h3>Learning outcome</h3>
            <p>
              While working on my first web store assignment I found out that there are a lot of
              unexpected challenges. I discover that with the help of “Media Query” we can create a
              separate design for devices with certain screen resolution and it helps me a lot in my
              assignment. When working with images it is a good practice to set the width property
              with the percentage and let the browser determine the best size of the image according
              to condition. When we need containers being on its own place and not jumping on the
              screen when we change a screen resolution the “Grid Layout Module” could help with
              this; it makes the page looks like a grid, so it becomes much easier to design. Also,
              we can take advantage of already created and tested frameworks provided by different
              web sites.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Honestly, there are a lot of tools that we can use while working on responsible
              design, but in my assignment, I mostly use “flex” and “grid”. The lesson I learned
              from the assignment: you have to think about a Responsive Design from the first line
              of code. Working on it afterward really bad Idea.

<!-- Requirements:

1. Header across the top must include your store's name, a logo,
and use a different background colour, web font, etc.  You must also include
a link to your contact.html page.  Your header should include info about
what the store is, what it sells, etc.  Use some images to try and draw
the user in.  NOTE: place all your site's images in the `src/images/` directory.

2. Below the header, a multi-column layout of items you can purchase in the
store.  You must have at least 10 items in your store, and at least 2
categories of items. For example, if you are selling clothing, you might
have categories for Men, Women, and Children, and each category would have
its own set of items.  Each item should include:

  - a picture
  - the item's name/title
  - a more complete description of the item
  - a category (i.e., each item must belong to a category)
  - a price.

Each item should be its own "card" (i.e., some kind of box around each item
separating one from the next, with suitable whitespace between).

3. A sidebar (left or right, depending on your design) of the item layout
section, showing the different categories of items in your store.  If a
user clicks on one of the categories, use CSS and JavaScript to hide all
other items in the store (i.e., only show items for the chosen category).
Make sure you include a way to return to seeing all categories, and make it
obvious to the user that they are only seeing a partial list of items when
you filter by category (i.e., use CSS and HTML to change things somehow).

4. Below the items, a footer with the name of the store, any relevant links you
need to give users, as well as a small HTML form for entering an Email
address and clicking a "Subscribe" button to subscribe to the store's
newsletter. Use https://formspree.io/ to automatically submit the form to
your email address (i.e., when a user fills out their email address and
clicks submit, *you* should get that information sent to your email
address via formspree.io).  Make sure you setup your account on
https://formspree.io/.

5. Use two different Web Fonts for your store.  The titles should be different
from any regular text.  Use a free font service like https://fonts.google.com/
or any other that you choose.  You can also experiment with different font
sizes and colours to draw attention toward or away from various parts of
your design.

6. Pick a colour theme using a tool like https://colorhunt.co/ with at least
3 colours (primary, secondary, accent), and use them throughout your site
for backgrounds, borders, fonts. Your store page needs to look attractive
and marks will be given for good a good looking site.  No one will buy from
a store that looks like its owners aren't professional or don't care about
details.  Also make sure that the colour contrast in your site is suitable
for everyone to read.

7. Use modern CSS to help you achieve your layout.  For example, Flexbox
and CSS Grid can help you create professional looking layouts.  Here
are some guides to get you started:

 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout
 
You are also welcome to use existing CSS libraries to help you with your layout,
but you must also include your own styles (i.e., you can't use a library
for everything in your design).

8. Make sure you don't use copyrighted materials from other sites.  If you use
icons, fonts, images, etc., make sure you are legally permitted to reuse them,
and include references to indicate where you got them. Some resources to consider:

  - https://unsplash.com/ for images
  - https://fontawesome.com/ for icons
  - https://gallery.manypixels.co/ or https://undraw.co/illustrations for illustrations (SVG)

9. Make sure you reduce the download size of images you include in your
store.  Users don't want to download 10s or 100s of megabytes of data, especially
on mobile.  You can use an online tool like https://squoosh.app/ to help you
reduce images.  You will lose marks if your images aren't optimized for the web.
 

10. Make sure you have no JavaScript or other errors in your Dev Tools Console.
Run your site, and test all aspects of it with the Console open, and fix
any issues you encounter.

11. Make sure your forms all work as they should, testing them yourself,
and also have someone else test it for you.  The easiest way to find bugs
in software is to let someone who didn't build it try to use it!
